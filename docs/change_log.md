## [v0.5.0](https://github.com/mesmo-dev/mesmo/releases/tag/v0.5.0) (upcoming release)

### New features

- Added new optimization problem object (`utils.OptimizationProblem`) as main interface for defining optimization problems with functionality to 1) export the standard form for LP / QP, 2) directly interface Gurobi for better performance with large problems.
- Overhead line types can now be defined in terms of conductor data and geometric arrangement (Arif Ahmed).
- Added local-approximation variant for linear electric grid model.
- Added linear model set for electric grid model, which enables defining separate linear models for each time step.
- Added power flow solution set, to obtain power flow solutions more conveniently for multiple time steps.
- Added pre-solve method for DER model set, to obtain baseline nominal power time series for flexible DERs.

### Changes

- Improved / simplified `define_optimization...()` methods for most use cases.
- Revised `define_optimization...()` methods for new optimization problem object.
- Switched from `multiprocess` to `ray` for parallel processing for performance reasons.
